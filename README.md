    This dish is called Tofu Bites, this was one of my first few dishes that my mom helped me make. I loved how it turned out, so I thought why not share it with you guys now!
Anyways, this is very easy recipe but it does require some parental supervision. So make sure to ask your parents to help you out! The outcome of this recipe is actually pretty good and tasty. I've provided you guys with all the ingredients and the steps you will need to make this recipe come to life. I hope you guys try this recipe out and you like it! Thanks!
